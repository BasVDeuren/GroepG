            <h4>Object</h4>

            <p>
                The object of the game is to control the most planets after a set number of turns have elapsed. On each
                turn,
                players are awarded a fixed number of command points and they can use those points to take two actions:

            <ul>
                <li>Move a ship from one planet to a neighboring planet</li>
                <li>Build a new ship at a planet they control</li>
                <li>Each action costs one command point.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>Moves</h4>

            <p>
                When moving a ship, a number of things can happen:
            <ul>
                <li>If the planet is unoccupied by a ship, the player takes control of the planet without a battle
                    If the planet is occupied by a ship owned by the player, the two ships are combined into a new ship
                    that
                    is
                    the
                    sum of their size
                </li>
                <li>If the planet is occupied by an opposing ship larger than the player's (attacking) ship, the
                    player's
                    ship
                    is
                    destroyed and the defending ship's size is reduced by one half of the size of the attacking ship
                </li>
                <li>If the planet is occupied by an opposing ship smaller than the player's ship, the defending ship is
                    destroyed,
                    the player takes control of the planet and the player's (attacking) ship is reduced in size by one
                    half
                    the
                    size
                    of the defending ship
                </li>
                <li>If the planet is occupied by an opposing ship the same size as the player's ship, both ships are
                    destroyed
                </li>
            </ul>
            A player may make their moves at any time as long as they have the command points to do so. When all
            players
            have exhausted their command points, the turn is ended. Players are awarded crack based on the planets
            they
            control.
            </p>

            <h4>Crack</h4>

            <p>

                All planets produce crack equal to one half of their size (using the default settings)
                Planets that are surrounded on six sides by friendly planets are "core" planets and produce a bonus
                quantity
                of
                crack (an additional half using the default settings)
                Crack is used to build ships. A planet consumes units of crack in equal numbers to its size to build a
                ship
                and
                the constructed ship is the size of the creating planet.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this way the game is played out turn by turn until the final turn elapses and the player that
                controls
                the
                most planets (regardless of planet size) is the winner. Ties are broken by the players' remaining crack
                supplies
                and if that ties as well, then there is simply a tie.
